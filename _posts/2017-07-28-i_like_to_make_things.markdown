I grew up copying my mom in everything she did. She had a reserved personality, I was a quiet kid. She liked to paint, I drew a lot. She built a new shed in the backyard, I built  ~~a pile of dirt and sticks~~ a sandcastle. She remodeled our kitchen, I gave my sandcastle a moat. 

She's worked with her hands and made things as long as I can remember. 

My mom worked really hard to give me every opportunity she could. She's worked at the same place for 23 years. They make EMI shielding; she designs parts and does rapid prototyping for their clients. 23 years ago she started as a low level employee on the assemply line. I've had a perfect example of endless curiosity and constant improvement, my entire life. 

I want to be endlessly curious and constantly improve. I want to make things. I've liked drawing since I was a kid. Filmmaking is endlessly fascinating; I can't comprehend how Bob Dylan even begins to write his songs. My girlfriend paid for me to take a wood working class; I made her a coffee table. I ~~need~~ want to make a bookshelf, an entertainment center, a cooler coffee table, whatever else wood is good for. 

Tic-Tac-Toe, repository of animal noises, an automated driving system, a simpler way to share photos. SPACE TRAVEL. Technology has built amazing things, and silly things. Programming opens doors to an endless number of workshops. 

My mom likes to make things. I like to make things.
